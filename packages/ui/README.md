# ui

Contains all customized front-end components. Most components are built with [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), therefore they only are created here if they require more than daisyUI.

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test ui` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
